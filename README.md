# PyMySQL Stubs #

Stubs for PyMySQL auto-generated and manually modified using mypy/stubgen.py based on Python 3.5. Hopefully included in future veersions of typeshed.

# Notes #

Since I am new to all this I would be glad to hear some feedback about the work and if there's an option to get this included in future versions of typeshed. Moreover I invite everybody to help me to improve the stubs, especially since it's my first contribution.
